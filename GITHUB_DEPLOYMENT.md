# Deploying to GitHub

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying your Django e-commerce project to GitHub.

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your local machine
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
- GitHub CLI (optional, for easier authentication)

## Steps to Deploy to GitHub

### 1. Initialize a Git Repository (if not already done)

Open a terminal/command prompt in your project root directory and run:

```bash
git init
```

### 2. Add Files to Git

Stage all files that should be included in your repository:

```bash
git add .
```

This will add all files except those specified in the `.gitignore` file.

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Create your first commit:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 4. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter a repository name (e.g., "ecommerce-django")
4. Add an optional description
5. Choose whether the repository should be public or private
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license
7. Click "Create repository"

### 5. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will display commands to connect your local repository. Use the commands under "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line":

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-django.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username and `ecommerce-django` with your repository name.

### 6. Verify the Deployment

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your project files and directories

## GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/django.yml`) that automatically runs tests when you push to the main branch or create a pull request.

To view the workflow:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. You'll see the workflow runs listed there

## Making Changes and Updates

After the initial deployment, you can make changes to your code and push them to GitHub:

1. Make your changes to the code
2. Stage the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
3. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```
4. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

## Branching Strategy (Optional)

For a more organized development workflow:

1. Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes and commit them
3. Push the branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature-name
   ```
4. Create a Pull Request on GitHub to merge your changes into the main branch

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. Use GitHub CLI for authentication:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
2. Or set up SSH keys for GitHub:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   Then add the public key to your GitHub account.

### Large Files

If you have large files that exceed GitHub's file size limit:
1. Add them to `.gitignore`
2. Or consider using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for large files
